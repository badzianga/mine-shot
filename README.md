# Mine Shot
Mine Shot is my first bigger project and my first game created for Crunchless Challenge. It's written in Python and Pygame. Although code is a mess, I'm somewhat proud of this game.

# Gameplay
Explore dark mines fighting enemies and upgrading your weapons. Your task is to get as many points as possible during escapade.
